Schema Tester
=============

This is a simple project that loads a schema and a model from two YAML files and validates the model using the schema. It's designed to be a way to explore JSON schemas and complex content modeling scenarios.


Usage
=====

1. Put your model in `model.yml` and your JSON schema in `schema.yml`.
2. Run `node validate.js` on a command line.

You should see either a `SUCCESS!` message or an explanation of your errors.
